# Terraform Setup for Azure VM

## Next Steps

1. **Replace the SSH Public Key Path**:
   - Open the `main.tf` file.
   - Find the line with `public_key = file("<path_to_your_generated_ssh_public_key>")`.
   - Replace `<path_to_your_generated_ssh_public_key>` with the path where you save your generated SSH public key.

2. **Save the Configuration**:
   - Ensure the configuration is saved in a file named `main.tf` in your project directory.

3. **Initialize Terraform**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to your project directory where `main.tf` is located.
   - Run the command:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     ```

4. **Validate the Configuration**:
   - Run the following command to validate the Terraform configuration:
     ```bash
     terraform validate
     ```

5. **Deploy the VM**:
   - To deploy the VM, run:
     ```bash
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Terraform will show you the changes it's going to make; type `yes` to proceed.

6. **Accessing the VM**:
   - Once the VM is deployed, you can access it using SSH:
     ```bash
     ssh azureuser@<public_ip_address>
     ```
   - Replace `<public_ip_address>` with the IP address output by Terraform.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions and subscriptions on Azure to create resources.
- Monitor your Azure subscription for usage and costs associated with the VM.
